The easiest way to add the connector to your code is to extract the project into your XCode 4 workspace.

== Save your project as a workspace ==
If you haven't already, upgrade your project to a workspace by selecting File->Save as Workspace...

== Extract the connector TAR file into your project folder ==
Download the latest version and extract the archive.  Inside you will see an atmos-ios folder and an atmos-ios.xcodeproj file.  Move these two items into your project folder

== Add the connector to your workspace ==
Inside XCode, right-click and Add Files To...  In the dialog, select the .xcodeproj folder.  You will see a 2nd project appear in your workspace.

== Build the Library ==
Before using, build the library once.  In your scheme list, pick "atmos-ios | iOS Device" and press Command-B to build it.  When done, switch back to your project's scheme.

== Add link target ==
Inside the project properties for your project, go to the "Build Phases" tab.  You'll see "Link Binary with Libraries".  Expand the section and press the + button.  You'll see a list of libraries and frameworks.  Under workspace you should see "libatmos.a".  Add this library and click OK.

== Add linker flags ==
There's currently a bug in the iOS compiler that prevents applications from seeing Objective-C Category objects in libraries.  To work around this, add the linker flag -all_load to Build Settings->Linking->Other Linker Flags.

== Add header search path ==
To find the library's headers, find Build Settings->Search Paths->Header Search Paths and add the value $(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/usr/local/include
