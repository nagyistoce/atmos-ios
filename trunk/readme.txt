== Linking against libatmos.a ==

Be sure to include -ObjC to your linker flags.

**Note: As of this writing, there is currently a bug in the iOS linker that
causes Objective-C categories to not load correctly.  You will see an 
Exception at runtime:
+[NSData dataWithBase64EncodedString:]: unrecognized selector sent to class

The current workaround is to use the -all_load flag to force loading all of
the library's modules.  For more information, see the footnote in:
http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1490/_index.html

== Generating Documentation ==
Documenation is generated by Apple's HeaderDoc utility.  It should be included
when you install XCode.

To build the documentation, use the headerdoc2html and gatherheaderdoc utils.
For example, to build the documentation to the 'doc' directory:

MacbookPro:atmos-ios jason$ mkdir doc

MacBookPro:atmos-ios jason$ headerdoc2html -o doc atmos-ios

MacBookPro:atmos-ios jason$ gatherheaderdoc doc
